Wanted to make a little to do list so I know what still has to be done. ref: https://gmos-ifu-1-data-reduction-tutorial-gemini-iraf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
 1) Instead of current flat calibration I would like to use vega as our standard star to make a sensitivity curve.
 2) Shift and stretch x-axis of the entire spectrum 
 3) Remove the light pollution (use daytime spectrum?)
